# PHP WebSocket
## Simple WebSocket server for PHP

Version: **1.0.0**

A simple websocket server for PHP 5.3, using streams.

### Features

- Supports websocket draft hybi-10,13 (Currently tested with Chrome 18 and
  Firefox 11).
- Supports origin-check.
- Supports various security/performance settings.
- Supports binary frames. (Currently receive only)
- Supports wss. (Needs valid certificate in Firefox.)


### Backward compatibility

The public API of the server should remain compatible with early versions of
php-websocket. The WebSocket namespace begins in the `/server/lib` directory.
The client-side libraries are deprecated and may be removed in future: the
exist as an example. You're free to use whatever client-side libraries you'd
like with the server.

## Installation

The library is PSR-0 compatible, with a vendor name of WebSocket (note the
capital S). An SplClassLoader is bundled for convenience.

## Usage

This creates a server on 127.0.0.1:8000 with one Application that listens on
`ws://localhost:8000/demo`:

```php
// $interface, $port, $ssl
$server = new \WebSocket\Server('127.0.0.1', 8000, false);

// Origin checking is supported
$server->setCheckOrigin(true);
$server->setAllowedOrigin('example.org')

// As is basic rate limiting
$server->setMaxClients(100);
$server->setMaxConnectionsPerIp(20);
$server->setMaxRequestsPerMinute(1000);

$server->registerApplication('demo', \WebSocket\Application\DemoApplication::getInstance());
$server->run();
```
